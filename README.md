# PasswordManager

This repo includes the source code and paper for my undergraduate dissertation project.
It is written in C# and uses a REST API to synchronize the database between devices.  

## Abstract

Passwords make up the backbone of modern authentication, therefore the types and the way
passwords are used should be taken very seriously. This paper explores the current state of the
art in security and authentication. This research will then be used to design, implement and
evaluate a functioning proof of concept secure password management system using industry
standard cryptography techniques. The systems design will encourage users to follow proper
password hygiene whilst allowing them to access this information from anywhere via the cloud.
